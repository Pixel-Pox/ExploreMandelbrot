# ExploreMandelbrot

#First try with Python Programming. 

#I wanted to create the Exploring tool for Mandelbrot set that allows zooming, snapshoting, collor pallete change, bilinear color algorithm and finally multiprocessing or cuda core calculations. 

Left to do: 
- Color pallete
- Color Algorithm
- Take a snapshot
- Multiprocessing
